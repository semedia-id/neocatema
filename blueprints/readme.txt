The page blueprints here are when you also intend to distribute your theme,
The theme will provide the page blueprints and it will be easier to use.

The best location for users is in the Data folder
(user/data/gantry5/themes/YOURTHEME/blueprints/)
(user/blueprints/)
otherwise your files may be lost during a theme update.
